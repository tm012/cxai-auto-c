                  <p style="font-size: 20px">22. Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) was sued on Wednesday in a proposed class action accusing Elon Musk's electric car company of misleading the public by falsely advertising its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features. The complaint accused Tesla and Musk of having since 2016 deceptively advertised the technology as fully functioning or "just around the corner" despite knowing that the technology did not work or was nonexistent, and made vehicles unsafe. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Report an ad Briggs Matsko, the named plaintiff, said Tesla did this to "generate excitement" about its vehicles, attract investments, boost sales, avoid bankruptcy, drive up its stock price and become a "dominant player" in electric vehicles. "Tesla has yet to produce anything even remotely approaching a fully self-driving car," Matsko said. The lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco seeks unspecified damages for people who since 2016 bought or leased Tesla vehicles with Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Report an ad Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It disbanded its media relations department in 2020. The lawsuit followed complaints filed on July 28 by California's Department of Motor Vehicles accusing Tesla of overstating how well its advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) worked.

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">23. Tesla’s “Full-Self Driving” (FSD) driver-assist feature does not offer what its name promises. 
Although Tesla CEO Elon Musk portrays the software as a prelude to fully autonomous vehicles, a quick online search shows videos of FSD-enabled Teslas in North America aiming straight at pedestrians, crashing into parked cars, and slowing down on a highway for no discernible reason. Unsurprisingly, more than a few observers have declared FSD to be a menace to traffic safety.

But if you look for similar videos of FSD-enabled Teslas stumbling their way through Europe’s cobblestone streets, you’ll come up empty. It’s not because Tesla’s system is better able to navigate San Sebastián than San Francisco; there are simply no FSD videos from Europe at all.
Why? FSD isn’t approved for public use there. 
Tesla cannot deploy FSD anywhere in the European Union unless it first obtains a green light from regulators. To obtain that approval, Tesla must convincingly demonstrate that cars with FSD are at least as safe as those without it. At least so far, it hasn’t.
Unlike their European peers, American car regulators do not require — or even offer — any kind of safety preapproval for a new car model or technology. Instead, car companies “self-certify” that their vehicles comply with federal guidelines pertaining to everything from steering wheels to brake fluids. But no such rules address the driver assistance and autonomous technologies that are critical to the car’s future — and to the safety of everyone who walks, bikes, or drives. 
Facing no significant oversight, automakers like Tesla can legally deploy any advanced driver-assist system (ADAS) they like, regardless of how dangerous it may be. According to federal law, only if the Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) observes a pattern of dangerous problems can it launch an investigation (which NHTSA is now doing with Tesla), potentially culminating in a recall. Until then, the cars under investigation can continue zooming along American roads and streets.
Musk himself summed up the transatlantic distinction during a speech earlier this year in Berlin: “In the US things are legal by default, and in Europe they’re illegal by default.”

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">24. Elon Musk said in a recent interview that it’s “essential” that Tesla solve its full self-driving technology (FSD). Musk feels that it should be the “overwhelming focus” for the carmaker because “it’s really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money or worth basically zero.”
Meanwhile, the driver-assist system has come under increased scrutiny from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The auto-safety agency expanded an investigation into Tesla’s and on Wednesday released a report that found Tesla’s using driver-assist systems were involved in 273 crashes over 9 months.
