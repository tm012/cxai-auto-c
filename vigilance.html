As more people get enrolled into the FSD Beta Program, here are a few (serious) limitations I wish I was aware before my first drive: It doesn't yet recognize speed bumps. Be prepared to brake. It nearly never responds correctly to blinking yellow lights and might jam on the brakes very hard in response. Be prepared to hit the accelerator. EDIT: 10.3 seems to have fixed this. I'm still boing to be more cautious around them, but then that's what a blinking yellow means, anyway! It doesn't seem to handle non-standard speed limit signs at all. I have many yellow speed limit signs around schools and curves in my area. Be prepared to slow down. Turns work great like 60-70% of the time. Maybe more. For the rest, be prepared to take over or give it a tap of the accelerator. Be ready to take over anytime you encounter construction or odd traffic conditions like non-90 degree intersections, railroad tracks, or anything that looks unusual. It might surprise you with how well it handles it, but it might also not handle it correctly at all. Lastly, and most importantly, it can drive by itself reliably like 95 to 98% of the time (by mileage or by time, whatever your metric is). Because of this, it is very easy to forget that it might occasionally (but exceedingly rarely) drive you 45 mph off the road. I put about 10 hours of FSD driving on before my first encounter with this. There were no warnings that it didn't understand the road, it just simply misread a lane. Stay alert. And keep your hands on the wheel!</p>
