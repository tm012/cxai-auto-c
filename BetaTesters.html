                  <p style="font-size: 20px">13. When Elon Musk wrote his Master Plan Part Deux, he mentioned that it would likely take about 6 billion autonomous miles before a self-driving system gets worldwide regulatory approval. A lot has happened since — from Tesla transitioning to a vision-only approach to the FSD Beta program being rolled out — but Musk’s 6 billion FSD miles estimate seems to have stayed the same. Musk recently reiterated his 6 billion FSD miles estimate on Twitter amid conversations with Tesla owners about the company’s Full Self-Driving Beta program. Musk had announced that FSD Beta 10.69.2 is now rolling out, though he also noted that users should expect the system to be overly-cautious. In later comments, Musk quipped that real-world validation and billions of miles of real-world training are what will make FSD superhuman. This comment incited further questions, one of which was from @Tesla__Mania, who asked the CEO if his 6 billion FSD miles estimate from Master Plan, Part Deux, still stands. Musk noted that such a number is “probably the right order of magnitude.” Musk is known for overly-ambitious targets that critics first find impossible, then later criticize for being late. The rollout of a full self-driving system is one of these, though the progress of the FSD Beta fleet since the program was launched in October 2020 has been undeniable. And with 100,000 beta testers using the system on real-world roads, FSD Beta is piling on the miles at a pretty rapid pace. As per Tesla’s Q2 2022 Update Letter in July, the company’s FSD Beta fleet has effectively driven over 35 million miles, the majority of which was attained since October 2021. And with Tesla potentially opening access to the FSD program to all paying customers in the United States by the end of the year, the total number of autonomous miles driven by the company’s fleet would likely grow even more aggressively. When Tesla announced that FSD Beta testers had already accumulated over 35 million miles, the program was already at a point where it had exceeded the cumulative miles of leaders in the autonomous driving field. Google’s Waymo, the company widely considered the leader in autonomous driving, for one, noted back in 2021 that its fleet had traveled 20 million real-world miles since 2009.

Later, Elon Musk announced that 10.69.2 seemed ready for a wide release to all FSD Beta testers. Around 100,000 drivers are part of the FSD Beta program. Musk noted that v.10.69.2 was good to roll out to Tesla owners who still ran v.10.12.2 and have been waiting for 10.69 for a few weeks. Tesla rolled out 10.69 in phases. In the first week, only 1,000 Beta testers received 10.69. The following week, Tesla released 10.69.1 to 10,000 more beta testers. The release for v.10.69.2 was initially scheduled for last week, though Tesla delayed the rollout to refine certain issues with v.10.69.1. However, the EV manufacturer released v10.69.1.1 to some more beta testers.

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">15. Elon Musk has told an early Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta tester not to complain about the new FSD Beta update. Isn’t that kind of their job? A job that not only they are not paid for, but that they are paying Tesla for the privilege of doing? FSD Beta enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car’s navigation system, but the driver needs to remain vigilant and ready to take control at all times. Since the responsibility lies with the driver and not Tesla’s system, it is still considered a level two driver-assist system despite its name. It has been sort of a “two steps forward, one step back” type of program, as some updates have seen regressions in terms of the driving capabilities. Tesla has been frequently releasing new software updates to the FSD Beta program and adding more owners to it. The company now has around 100,000 owners in the program, and with more people in it, it is expected to have more data to train its neural nets. But those beta testers are also providing feedback for Tesla to directly improve on its system. In the latest update, the automaker even took direct feedback to attempt a specific left turn that an early tester has been attempting with FSD Beta. With the latest update (10.69), Tesla is only slowly rolling out the update to some of the early beta testers. CEO Elon Musk said it was out of extra caution due to several important code changes. One of those early beta testers took to Twitter to complain about FSD Beta still needing “lots of work on basic control” after the latest update, and Musk responded by asking him not to complain.

Tesla started adding to its FSD Beta Program on Monday, June 6. A few Tesla owners who received a 95 safety score shared their excitement about getting into the program on Twitter.
