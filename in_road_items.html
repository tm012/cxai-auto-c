As more people get enrolled into the FSD Beta Program, here are a few (serious) limitations I wish I was aware before my first drive: It doesn't yet recognize speed bumps. Be prepared to brake. It nearly never responds correctly to blinking yellow lights and might jam on the brakes very hard in response. Be prepared to hit the accelerator. EDIT: 10.3 seems to have fixed this. I'm still boing to be more cautious around them, but then that's what a blinking yellow means, anyway! It doesn't seem to handle non-standard speed limit signs at all. I have many yellow speed limit signs around schools and curves in my area. Be prepared to slow down. Turns work great like 60-70% of the time. Maybe more. For the rest, be prepared to take over or give it a tap of the accelerator. Be ready to take over anytime you encounter construction or odd traffic conditions like non-90 degree intersections, railroad tracks, or anything that looks unusual. It might surprise you with how well it handles it, but it might also not handle it correctly at all. Lastly, and most importantly, it can drive by itself reliably like 95 to 98% of the time (by mileage or by time, whatever your metric is). Because of this, it is very easy to forget that it might occasionally (but exceedingly rarely) drive you 45 mph off the road. I put about 10 hours of FSD driving on before my first encounter with this. There were no warnings that it didn't understand the road, it just simply misread a lane. Stay alert. And keep your hands on the wheel!</p>

My main issues are how much it hugs the yellow line (not very safe or comfortable on a 2-lane road where there are frequent semi trucks), and for some reason it brakes almost every time an oncoming car approaches, even when they're fully in their lane and off toward the shoulder.</p>

It would give you more chance to avoid a deer if it jumps onto the road. On a slower suburban road, I also drive closer to the middle in case there is a random kid popping out. Even when driving under the low speedlimit. Obviously when there is a car approaching, I make room (and may even slow down more depending on the situation)</p><hr>

If the light turns yellow and it thinks you're not going to make it, it will lose it's mind with sound alerts and red warnings flashing on the screen. This also happens if it gets confused about road markings and thinks it's going to crash. Elon (Musk) said their criteria for getting into the FSD beta will depend on how you drive and whether or not the car is freaking out a bunch like I mentioned above. But the fact is that it's sometime unavoidable because the car is just overly-cautious sometimes. Full Self Driving for us regular folks is limited to single-road driving. Meaning, it will not turn from one street onto another or take you from point A to B. If you want into the beta, you gotta drive like a saint for "7 days." And access can be revoked any time even after it's granted.</p>

Just today, I was driving at 70 miles an hour on the highway, and I reached an area where traffic was absolutely stopped. The car refused to recognize several rows of stopped cars, and if I had not pressed the brake hard, I would have a rear ended a car at 70 miles an hour. This cannot be. It has to change! where’s FSD Beta on this? Anyone know?</p>

Who needs to go to Disneyland for Mr. Toad’s wild ride? I’m happy to be part of the process and I hope we can see it get to useful. Two highlights today…Unlike the YouTube video that was posted here from Milwaukee, the car had no problem driving around to avoid a similar construction barrier. The car headed straight for the gore point at one on-ramp. I thought we had that one figured out. Ditto to everything said about hogging the center of the road, and failing to use bike lanes properly. My safety score is still visible, and has dropped to 98 due to a FCW immediately after a disengagement.</p>

                     <p>Yes! That’s a great way to describe it. Though my experience was a residential road the car drove down the middle. With on coming traffic the car did indeed move over to the right side in time, but it did feel a little like a game of chicken and could tell the other car was slowing a bit. Heck made me a nervous too.. If it would have stayed to the right side of the road a bit more it probably wouldn’t have felt that way and not noticeable. We’re talking about 6 ft here so just that bit on a residential road does make me feel extra cautious and ready for the take over.</p><hr>

                     <p>Remember that the reason why we're testing is to get more experiences in front of the software. I'm not surprised that my 15 mile roundtrip from our apartment in Fishers IN to Geist and back was filled with brake checks, poor lane choices and such. Interspersed with those were moments of sheer brillance. We're testers collecting more data to make FSD better. Those improvements will speed up as more data comes in with 1000+ more testers.</p><hr>
                     <p>It will be interesting to see if FSD gets better even without a software update. Tesla said in the past that our "driving mishaps " would be crunched up by its software and resulting AI improvements downloaded to the fleet.</p><hr>

                     <p>I've experienced that at some but not all intersections. At the intersections where the car behaves correctly, it will display a message saying “Waiting our turn”. I wonder if this is a data mapping issue. I also have a case where I'm making a left from a main road onto a side road. The side road has a stop sign, the main road does not. The car proceeds just fine if there is no car waiting at the stop sign on the side road. However, if there is a car waiting then my car comes to a screeching halt until I intervene. It's as if the car doesn't know it has the right of way.</p><hr>
                     <p>I've seen it handle 3 way and 4 way stop intersections with other cars ok. Perhaps you're not waiting long enough. But then again your intervention may be helping train it when to go.</p><hr>
                     <p>I've also gotten the "waiting our turn" message, but it won't proceed even when it IS our turn. Shows another car in blue proceed (assume blue means that vehicle has the right of way first), but then it marks the vehicle behind it blue as soon as the lead vehicle clears the intersection. No, it lets multiple cars through. Seems to not realize the other street ALSO has a stop sign, so could be a mapping issue, but I'd assumed that was handled by the cameras not map data. Interesting point though. Does the camera have enough clarity to read under the stop sign, and does it differentiate if it says 3, 4, all way? If not, does it determine the cross streets have a stop sign based off the BACK of their sign (would be pretty cool if that's how it determines other streets having stop signs). These are the type of details early beta testers should be told. This way it'd help us understand why/how our vehicles behave and what we can expect. </p><hr>
                     <p>The 3/4 way stops have been hit or miss for me. I've definitely had one scenario where the car wouldn't budge even after all the cars were gone. Overall my experience has gotten better over the week, but I attribute that mostly to different routes. It does fairly well in neighborhoods, but a bit less so elsewhere. Curious if anyone will be able to notice a difference on Fri/Sat with 10.3</p><hr>

                     <p>Is this Independence? FSD actually works without a center line?</p><hr>
                     <p>This is a tough call…I somewhat recall there was a case here in Canada a few years where a driver slammed on the brakes to avoid some ducks on a highway. Vehicles behind didn’t stop in time and a horrendous crash ensued. The driver that stopped to avoid the 🦆 was found to be at fault. Moral of the story: do we really want FSD slamming hard on the brakes everytime a bird is in the way and potentially causing a rear ender?</p><hr>
                     <p>The benefit of all the cameras is that FSD can make that decision correctly in most cases. It should be aware of vehicles behind it to know if a sudden stop is safe. Basically, this ends up being the classic trolley problem for the AI whether it is better to kill few to save many.</p><hr>
                     <p>There has to be a line somewhere. Driving on a rural highway at 60MPH, you absolutely have to slam on the brakes if a deer enters your lane. Perhaps the best approach is what humans do -- look for wildlife on the sides of the road, and slow if any is detected. This way nobody has to slam on the brakes at all.</p><hr>
                     <p>They can use the rear camera to detect if there is a tailgater/chances of being rear ended. Can also determine the severity of getting rear ended ie if its a 18 wheeler. With that info they would simply plow into whatever Non-human animal is in front to avoid injury. Endangered or not a human takes priority over all animals.</p><hr>
                     <p>Here in Australia it’s vital to avoid the Roos. FSD would be good at this because it can look at angles – if you can pick out kangaroos on the side of the road in front of you at dawn and dusk, that would be a huge advantage. Kangaroos are drongos and wait until you’re just about to pass them before jumping into the road in front of you. Because they are big and jump up into the windscreen they can cause fatalities to the car occupants, not just themselves.</p><hr>
                     <p>It's taught very prominently, where I live (In WA), that if you don't have enough time to assess around you, to see whether it's safe to swerve, that the better option is to go right through it. Even Roos. If you're braking and you hit it, it may write off your car, but the chances are you'll be ok. If you swerve and hit another vehicle. Chances are that both you and the occupants of the other vehicle are dead. My driving instructors were very, very clear on this. Not sure if they make as big of a deal in areas Roos are not as populus. Obviously, in the car's case, those sensors are completely aware of what is around it all the time. So it should be able to determine whether it's safe to avoid or not. But, Human's do not have the input capacity of a computer.</p><hr>
                     <p>FSD should have detection for any debris, or blockage in the road, regardless of animal type, or anything for that matter. Put simply, it shouldn’t need to detect what the object is, but rather, that an object is in its path at all. Now the visuals on the screen are a whole other form of classification. But in its purest form, FSD doesn’t care what the object is. It would have stopped had you not intervened, and had it not stopped when you intervened then clearly you found one of the bugs within the Beta. Edit: People seem to be misinterpreting the word DETECTION and confusing it with INTERVENTION. The car can and should be able to detect ANYTHING in its path, regardless of its classification. It then classifies the object in its path to determine if INTERVENTION is needed. In OPs case, the car likely would have detected the bird and likely stopped since it was in the direct path. IDC about "what about highway, etc etc." Talking simply detection of objects in front of vehicle.</p><hr>

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">17. So, I just did a little trip tonight with little to no traffic. We SERIOUSLY need some guidance from the FSD engineering team about what sorts of things they want us to report. WHAT DO THEY WANT TO KNOW? For example, the car turned into a bike lane and drove in it for a little bit before figuring out it wasn't supposed to be there and it very abruptly moved into the correct lane. I was too busy minding the car to push the "report" icon. On residential streets with no center stripe the car drove right down the center, even when cars come at you the other way, FSD had a hard time with that. It did our roundabout in town, but only after stopping and thinking about it for a while and then proceeded with "great haste" to get through it. Unacceptable if there were any other cars on the road. Then it gave up driving over our Otowi bridge. Two lanes were closed off for bridge repairs and the cones directed us into the "wrong lane" (which was set up for 2 way traffic) and it freaked out and gave up. All of these incidents are interesting and reportable I think... but do they want to hear about ALL of them? I dare not take my hands off the wheel or eyes off the road to push the little report icon every time. It's all very very cool and I want to be a useful beta tester but I need some advice on how to best report all these things. I did send a report Email tonight and asked this very question. I'll post here if I get some good feedback.</p>
