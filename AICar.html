                  <p style="font-size: 20px">1. Earlier this year, Elon Musk forecasted that Tesla Full Self-Driving could be released to qualified vehicles by the end of 2022. Tesla’s Senior Director of Investor Relations Martin Viecha recently noted that the company was on track to release “supervised” FSD within Musk’s predicted timeline.
At an invite-only Goldman Sachs tech conference, Viecha provided information about Tesla’s plans for the next five years. He discussed Tesla’s battery supply, plans for a cheaper EV model, and finally “supervised” FSD, reported Insider. 
The Tesla executive explained that “supervised” FSD is basically “supervised autonomy,” meaning the driver is still an active participant in the car’s mobility. When Tesla widely releases Full Self-Driving at the end of the year, drivers must still pay attention to the road and follow proper driving practices. 
Viecha hinted that drivers who do not drive responsibly with FSD would lose access to the service, similar to how drivers in the FSD Beta program lose access to their advanced driver-assist systems when they drive irresponsibly. He added that Tesla collects more data from interventions, meaning the company learns more from drivers who actively correct Full Self-Driving’s movements. 
“We profoundly believe mass collection of data and AI is only way to solve generalized autonomy. That’s the path we’re taking,” Viecha said. 
Currently, Tesla FSD Beta is only available to 100,000 testers who passed the company’s Safety Score and other requirements. It recently rolled out update 10.69.2 to Beta testers. 
Elon Musk has stated that v10.69.2 should introduce significant improvements to FSD Beta. Some Teslarati readers who are in the program described some of the issues they still experience with the software, including phantom braking, problems with speed limits, and turns. However, some testers have also noted that the improvements that the Full Self-Driving Beta software have exhibited over the past months have been notable.

Chuck Cook, whose left turn has inspired Tesla to name it after him in the release notes, said that he’d already done two drives and that it was as polished as it needed to be for the release. He added that there were unnecessary pauses with VRUs (vulnerable road targets) which make sense considering what Elon Musk said on Twitter about the software being cautious around pedestrians. Chuck shared some additional thoughts about the latest version of the software with Teslarati. “The new features Tesla has added in the Tesla FSD Beta 10.69.2 release such as new deep lane guidance, a new creep limit, and multi-lane median behavior and pose are all amazing. But they are doing it with caution by being very cautious with pedestrian traffic which is warranted but still needs a bit more tweaking to feel human-like when driving,” he told Teslarati. “The convergence between map data and vision continues to present many challenges that need to be refined in the coming releases as we progress towards a single stack AKA v11,” Chuck added.

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">3. Starting this week, Tesla's so-called Full Self-Driving system will now cost buyers $15,000, up from $12,000, or a $199 monthly subscription fee. But with this price hike, is it any closer to Level 3 systems currently being rolled out by other automakers? A few days ago Tesla CEO Elon Musk said it was his goal to see FSD in wide release by the end of 2022, once again promising Tesla vehicles would be capable of "self-driving." But the system, still considered to be Level 2 by industry experts (as is Tesla's Autopilot), does not appear to be on its way to becoming Level 3 or Level 4 with its current suite of hardware and software, which permit users to completely divert their attention from the road for minutes or hours at a time, while the earliest cars with FSD that buyers bought years ago are getting older. 
At this point, as in years past, it's difficult to pinpoint just what Musk means by "self driving." The company admitted to California regulators over a year ago that FSD is not meant to exceed Level 2 functions, which require drivers to remain alert, monitor the road, and be ready to assume control at all times. Tesla itself in its official instructions requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel and to pay attention to traffic—tasks surprisingly similar to just driving—while not promising eyes-off and hands-off capabilities. "The currently enabled Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous," the automaker says on its website. "Full autonomy will be dependent on achieving reliability far in excess of human drivers as demonstrated by billions of miles of experience, as well as regulatory approval, which may take longer in some jurisdictions." These requirements by Tesla make its systems Level 2 by definition, according to industry experts, and therefore a driver-assist system rather than a "self-driving" or autonomous vehicle by widely accepted industry definitions. The Tesla CEO has shied away from the official Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) autonomous driving levels, and does not really talk about Autopilot, FSD, and FSD Beta using that terminology. Likewise, in announcing various software updates, the company has not relied on SAE levels, instead focusing on minute changes to various functions within FSD, and software versions expressed in strings of numbers. "There are many major code changes, so this will be an extra cautious rollout," Musk tweeted in August, referencing a planned wider release of FSD Beta. "Releasing on 8/20 to ~1000 Tesla owners, then 10.69.1 next week to accommodate feedback & release to ~10k customers, then 10.69.2 week after & release to rest of FSD Beta." Musk has hinted in the past that FSD itself will become more expensive over time as the system approaches more complete functionality, though once again, it is difficult to tell unambiguously which SAE Level would be reached by Full Self-Driving five years from now, for instance. Musk has also recently chided one FSD Beta tester for offering feedback regarding the system—ostensibly the purpose of beta testing—prompting him to apologize.

However, today we have gotten conflicting information that suggests, Tesla is planning to bring back updated HD radar to the company's vehicles with the upcoming Autopilot Hardware 4 upgrade.
In May 2021, Tesla officially moved from a radar-vision hybrid self-driving system to one that solely relies on cameras. Previous to this change, Tesla vehicles, in order to execute automatic emergency breaking and for self-driving purposes, used to rely on radar to offer 160 meters of forward protection. However, now Tesla has moved to a pure camera system the autopilot section of the EV maker’s website mentions “Powerful visual processing at up to 250 meters of range”.

His response on Twitter was to a question asked by Giovanni Asmar for reset strikes on FSD Beta. Elon replied, “Coming,” but so far, we don’t know when that would be. Perhaps in the next update? Tesla’s five strikes system is focused on ensuring that its FSD Beta testers are paying attention as they test the software. When the system detects that the driver isn’t paying attention, it gives them a strike. Drivers can get a strike for being distracted, not looking at the road, looking too long at the display, or looking at their phone while the car is driving.

It could also help detect test conditions and locations, imposing another behavior from automatic emergency braking (AEB) and other safety assist systems. If that is the case, it could be comparable to what Volkswagen did with its cheat code in the EA-189 turbodiesel engines. You now know this episode as Dieselgate.

Paul Maric, from CarExpert, saw GreenTheOnly’s tweet only ten minutes after he posted it and broke the news following quite an interesting public conversation with the hacker. In it, GreenTheOnly reminded us that Euro NCAP testing methods might make things even easier for Tesla. He said that the entity receives cars directly from the manufacturers.
According to the organization, that only happens in a few cases, mostly when the vehicles are still not for sale. In that case, Euro NCAP will randomly select them at their manufacturing site or from a list provided by the manufacturer.

The Tesla Model Y may be on track to become the world’s best-selling vehicle in the near future, but at the end of the day, the all-electric crossover is still a premium electric car that’s unattainable to a large portion of the car buying public. If Tesla would like to dominate the auto industry, it would need to release an affordable EV that can be purchased even by entry-level consumers. 

The idea of an affordable EV from Tesla is not new, though in Elon Musk’s Master Plan, Part Deux, he noted that a lower cost electric car might not be necessary anymore after the Model 3 because of the company’s Robotaxi plans. But with the Robotaxi program being delayed — at least until Tesla solves autonomous driving — and the rising starting prices of the Model 3 and Model Y as of late, the need for a more affordable EV from Tesla is becoming quite evident. 
While speculations of an affordable EV from Tesla have been abounding for years, Elon Musk has taken a conservative stance on the matter. In recent months, Musk has hinted at the idea of Tesla simply releasing a dedicated, futuristic Robotaxi instead of a more affordable EV. Tesla’s Robotaxi will reportedly be made with autonomy in mind, and in the Q2 2022 Update Letter, the vehicle was actually listed as “in development.” 

According to Tesla head of investor relations Martin Viecha, however, the company may need to release a more affordable EV before the rollout of the dedicated Robotaxi. Viecha shared his thoughts during an invite-only Goldman Sachs tech conference in San Francisco. The Tesla executive’s comments were shared to Insider by an attendee of the event. 

When Viecha was asked about the possibility of Tesla making a more affordable EV, the executive stated that the company eventually wants to release a cheaper vehicle on the road. The head of investor relations noted that if Tesla wants to be a high-volume automaker, then it would need a broad portfolio — one that includes a more affordable offering. That being said, the demand for the Model 3 and Model Y has been stronger than expected, so the need for a new vehicle is not that notable for now, according to the executive. 

While Elon Musk is evidently all-in on Tesla’s Robotaxi future, it would likely still be a mistake for the company to ignore or neglect the affordable vehicle segment. Companies like Toyota, after all, did not rise to the top by just making premium cars. Apart from this, the affordable EV market is quite important for the global transition to electric cars, as such vehicles are extremely popular in countries where cars like the Model 3 are still out of reach for mainstream buyers.

A tweet came the day after Apple's iPhone 14 unveiling event where Apple announced the Emergency SOS via satellite. This new feature will allow iPhone 14 users to reach emergency services using satellite communication in remote areas.
Apple partnered with Globalstar Inc. to power the satellite infrastructure. However, it's still possible we could see a similar collaboration between SpaceX and Apple in the future as they have had hopeful discussions.
These discussions come after SpaceX and U.S. wireless carrier T-Mobile announced a collaboration. The companies revealed that phone users on T-Mobile’s network will be able to use SpaceX satellites to send text messages in remote areas without cellular connectivity. The collaboration will go into effect after SpaceX launches Version 2 Starlink satellites.
It should be noted that Apple’s new feature will differ from T-Mobile's feature in collaboration with SpaceX. T-Mobile's feature will allow for communication between consumers while Apple’s short-length satellite texting service is designed to reach emergency responders only.
This will make the iPhone 14 the first commercially available smartphone with satellite in the U.S. The satellite infrastructure will also integrate with Apple’s Find My app, allowing users' devices to be accurately tracked in remote areas where GPS and cellular services may not work.

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">9. In a video and Twitter Thread, Ashok explained how Tesla developed Occupancy Networks to literally give the car a sense of its surroundings. Humans have the ability to understand the objects around them at any given time. Is that car down the road moving at a slow speed or a fast speed? Do I, a pedestrian, have enough time to get across the street before being hit? What is that in the middle of the road? What is that falling from the sky? I should move out the way.
These reactions to scenarios and split-second decisions come naturally to humans. Tesla’s Autopilot Team is working to program the vehicles to do the same thing and this will save lives. Imagine the car being able to correctly detect its surroundings while the driver isn’t even paying attention. An example is sudden unintended accelerations (SUA). Ashok pointed out that Autopilot prevents around 40 of these types of accidents daily.
The workshop was held in June at this year’s Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR.) in New Orleans. Ashok explained that the team developed Occupancy Networks which enable the car to predict the volumetric occupancy of everything around it.
Ashok explained that the typical approaches such as image-space segmentation of free space or pixel-wise depth have many issues. The solution to those issues is Occupancy Networks.

The 10 million square foot building is a sight to behold for those of us who have seen it in person. Even more so if you’ve been inside of it.

Musk pointed out that the Tesla’s free cash flow generation has been trending upward since 2017. He noted that it continued to rise before Tesla could reach full autonomy. His comments hint at autonomy’s potential profit when Tesla officially launches it to the public.

“We have autonomy to some degree, said Elon Musk. “But solving autonomy will really be an amplification of free cash flow to a degree that is—You know you run the numbers, and its like ‘wow, can it really be that crazy?’ But it could be that crazy.”
