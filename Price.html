                  <p style="font-size: 20px">26. Starting this week, Tesla's so-called Full Self-Driving system will now cost buyers $15,000, up from $12,000, or a $199 monthly subscription fee. But with this price hike, is it any closer to Level 3 systems currently being rolled out by other automakers? A few days ago Tesla CEO Elon Musk said it was his goal to see FSD in wide release by the end of 2022, once again promising Tesla vehicles would be capable of "self-driving." But the system, still considered to be Level 2 by industry experts (as is Tesla's Autopilot), does not appear to be on its way to becoming Level 3 or Level 4 with its current suite of hardware and software, which permit users to completely divert their attention from the road for minutes or hours at a time, while the earliest cars with FSD that buyers bought years ago are getting older. 
At this point, as in years past, it's difficult to pinpoint just what Musk means by "self driving." The company admitted to California regulators over a year ago that FSD is not meant to exceed Level 2 functions, which require drivers to remain alert, monitor the road, and be ready to assume control at all times. Tesla itself in its official instructions requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel and to pay attention to traffic—tasks surprisingly similar to just driving—while not promising eyes-off and hands-off capabilities. "The currently enabled Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous," the automaker says on its website. "Full autonomy will be dependent on achieving reliability far in excess of human drivers as demonstrated by billions of miles of experience, as well as regulatory approval, which may take longer in some jurisdictions." These requirements by Tesla make its systems Level 2 by definition, according to industry experts, and therefore a driver-assist system rather than a "self-driving" or autonomous vehicle by widely accepted industry definitions. The Tesla CEO has shied away from the official Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) autonomous driving levels, and does not really talk about Autopilot, FSD, and FSD Beta using that terminology. Likewise, in announcing various software updates, the company has not relied on SAE levels, instead focusing on minute changes to various functions within FSD, and software versions expressed in strings of numbers. "There are many major code changes, so this will be an extra cautious rollout," Musk tweeted in August, referencing a planned wider release of FSD Beta. "Releasing on 8/20 to ~1000 Tesla owners, then 10.69.1 next week to accommodate feedback & release to ~10k customers, then 10.69.2 week after & release to rest of FSD Beta." Musk has hinted in the past that FSD itself will become more expensive over time as the system approaches more complete functionality, though once again, it is difficult to tell unambiguously which SAE Level would be reached by Full Self-Driving five years from now, for instance. Musk has also recently chided one FSD Beta tester for offering feedback regarding the system—ostensibly the purpose of beta testing—prompting him to apologize.

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">27. Tesla's FSD software continues to improve and will only get better as more and more vehicles begin to use it. In fact, by the end of next year, I see Tesla's FSD software as being significantly better than the average human driver - not just a little bit better.
One of the most fascinating things to have watched over the last couple years is the progress of Tesla's FSD software. A couple years ago, it was a bunch of lines and dots on a screen as Tesla first began to have people test it on the roads.
By this time next year, I expect that Tesla's FSD software will be out of beta and available to anyone who wants to buy it or use it as a subscription. It is $15,000 to buy it up front at the time of writing this article, something I cannot presently afford for my Model 3, but I will br trying it out as a subscription to see if I can make my Model 3 a robotaxi.
The fleet learning is the magic of how Tesla's FSD software gets better. As more and more people use it, more training takes place with more scenarios and situations. It's just like when you turned 16 and learned how to drive. You didn't do very well at first, but you started to learn different situations and get better.
The great thing about Tesla FSD is that it is always on and thinking and never distracted. A human can get distracted, tired, and make mistakes. Eventually, mistakes will be few by Tesla's FSD software and any human intervention will be error.

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">28. Tesla has hiked the price of Full Self-Driving. Fisker is looking for more production space for its Ocean. BYD is entering Europe on its own—and, perhaps, heading into Tesla battery packs. And the EV tax credit revamp has triggered a massive price hike in EV and PHEV lease prices. This and more, here at Green Car Reports. 
In recent days, EV and PHEV lease prices have soared. That’s mostly because a vast swath of models are no longer eligible for the EV tax credit, and captive lease firms are passing some or all of that amount along to the consumer.
Fisker says that it’s exploring ways to expand production of its upcoming Ocean electric SUV beyond its originally intended 50,000 units per year. That might potentially mean production in the U.S.—which might make the model, which starts at $37,499 in Ocean Sport form, once again eligible for the EV tax credit. 
China’s BYD is entering the European market on multiple fronts. While it announced earlier this month how it plans to sell its passenger cars in Germany, Sweden, and beyond, it’s also reportedly delivering its LFP Blade batteries to Tesla’s Giga Berlin plant for installation in vehicles as soon as late August. 
And Tesla has hiked the price of what it calls Full Self-Driving—to $15,000 as of September 5. With its latest version 10.69 software, it’s also expanding the city-street beta-testing that has generated much controversy in recent months.

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">29. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been promising customers a driverless vehicle since at least 2016.

While the company hasn’t delivered on that promise, Tesla lets thousands of employees and customers try new and unfinished driver assistance features on public roads in the U.S. through a program called Full Self Driving Beta, or FSD Beta.  

Only Tesla owners who have the company’s premium FSD driver assistance system installed in their cars can join the FSD Beta program. (That option costs $12,000 up front or $199 per month in the U.S. today.) Owners must then obtain a high driver-safety score, as determined by Tesla software that monitors their driving habits, and maintain it to keep FSD Beta access. No safety certification or professional training is required.

FSD Beta can best be summarized as a host of new features that are not yet debugged. Chief among them is “autosteer on city streets,” which lets the car navigate around complex urban environments automatically.

In January and February, CNBC rode along with three Tesla owners who are participants in FSD Beta to get an uncensored look at how the system works -- and doesn’t -- today.

All three drivers understood that the technology does not make their Tesla electric cars fully self driving, despite the brand name. The vehicles with FSD Beta engaged maneuvered around some suburban and rural roads successfully, but suffered some dramatic glitches as well, especially in crowded urban environments.
