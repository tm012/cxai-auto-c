My main issues are how much it hugs the yellow line (not very safe or comfortable on a 2-lane road where there are frequent semi trucks), and for some reason it brakes almost every time an oncoming car approaches, even when they're fully in their lane and off toward the shoulder.</p>

                     <p>If there is no oncoming traffic, I get closer to the yellow line, especially if there is limited visibility on the sides (trees, etc.). It would give you more chance to avoid a deer if it jumps onto the road. On a slower suburban road, I also drive closer to the middle in case there is a random kid popping out. Even when driving under the low speedlimit. Obviously when there is a car approaching, I make room (and may even slow down more depending on the situation)</p><hr>

So I've been seeing a lot of people talking about their experiences in very hyperbolic ways, good and bad, but I feel like a lot of the bad is from misaligned expectations. Having now used the beta for a while and driven hundreds of miles on all my daily routes, and being very satisfied with it despite its problems I though I'd share why I feel that way. In doing so I hope to help others who have either just gotten or will soon get the beta have the best experience. First and foremost remember that despite the name this is NOT FSD. This is City Streets, and a beta at that. The goal with this step is not to make your car autonomous, but to enhance its existing capabilities to be much more useful off highway. Think of it as NoA for off highway. With that expectation I suspect you will have a much better time dear reader, because it will affect how you interact with the system. For example: Rather than expecting the car to simply get you from point A to B without your input, think of it as trying to reduce your workload. With turns from stops I can focus on looking for cars and making sure the car waits for and gets the right gap rather than worrying about creeping into someone coming the other way. With turns off roads I can focus on making sure the car gets the angle right rather than worrying about braking. What AP did for going straight, this does for taking turns. It will mess up, but the point isn't that it will do things for you, its that you can focus on making sure it does it right rather than doing it right yourself. If you felt comfortable using public AP and knew how to handle it well, you'll be fine. The mental workload is honestly no worse. (Hell for me personally, the roads, and amount of turns I take, it's less) That said, roads where you couldn't use AP before can be rough. Unmarked roads in particular require attention as it likes to hug the center until there's a car coming and it's relatively close. Thing is, if markings fade or are washed out by the sun it can treat them the same too. But so long as you watch out, and put in the energy you're really supposed to be putting in with public AP you'll be okay. And as long as you remember that this is supposed to be NoA off highway, you'll have a good time. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.</p>

                     <p>My only complaint is the lane centering when on side streets that arent marked. The car will straddle the center line until another car is so close that the owner has to be really freaked out. If it understands where objects are and how to center itself it has to be an offset change to make it move further over to the right side of the road. Where it should be. Everything beyond this is excusable as the general turning errors feel as if it's learning but messing up, lane centering is something that I know tesla has done before (moving over in the lane when passing large vehicles) so I can't excuse it and is honestly responsible for 90%+ of my disengagement.
</p><hr>
                     <p>That centering also occurs in two lane highways with extra unmarked lanes for parked cars. It drives down the center of the 2 right lanes, swerves left for each parked car then centers itself the same way. It's a bit unnerving.</p><hr>
                     <p>Not just that, but there is some pretty dangerous behavior at stop signs / stop lights on the small streets we have on the west side of LA. Right up against the curb there is a lane for cars to parallel and it is separated from traffic by a solid line: https://i.imgur.com/1u15bnX.png When you are pulling up to a stop the solid line turns to dashed lines and that lane becomes a turn lane for the stop since cars are not allowed to park there. FSD doesn't know how to handle that though and tries to make a turn from the main lane, which is not what the other drivers on the road / pedestrians would expect a turning car to do and could cause issues</p><hr>
                     <p>I want to agree with you, but my experience with FSD beta is that it doesn't reduce my workload at all. If anything, it increases my workload, anxiety, and stress of driving. Now I don't mind that because I knew what I was signing up for, but where AP and NoA are genuinely useful tools to reduce workload, FSD is far from that and is ready at any moment to cause an accident. I really wanted FSD beta to be like NoA for city streets, but in my experience, I feel like an unpaid alpha tester. Again, I sort of expected this, but I don't want people to have an expectation that FSD beta is anything like NoA or normal AP. Those are useful tools to reduce workload. FSD beta increases mental load, stress, and anxiety while using it in hopes that our testing efforts will one day bring a truly useful tool to the masses.</p><hr>
                     <p>For me, FSD beta is way more jerky and stressful on straight / curvy drives vs standard ap. Occasionally FSD outright dies (with the 'autopilot cameras unavailable' error) and I can't even use regular AP until I deep reset the car.</p><hr>

It's not really the beginning of single stack as much as slightly different logic using the same mechanisms. I've observed an issue with lane changing where if you're on a three lane highway and you're in the far right lane, and someone is in the far left lane, and the center lane is empty, the car repeatedly has issues telling whether the vehicle in the far left lane is in fact in the left lane. I initiated a lane change to the center lane and the car aborted back to the right lane because the car in the left most lane "drifted" into the center lane. The car in the far left never "drifted", the car simply misjudged it and aborted it. When on FSD Beta you're basically using the "bare minimum" autopilot that the Pure Vision folks got when they took the radar out. I will say that when the lane changes do work its much more smooth than when the radar was in play. The only real comparison I can give is that radar based lane changing felt more programmatic, in that you would start to signal, the car would validate that it could change lanes, change lanes, then go back to "Normal autopilot". Now you turn the signal on and it just goes over. It doesn't feel like a program's subroutine just kicked in to perform a task. But there's no "single stack" in play here yet, it's just that you're seeing tasks performed without the radar now. Go Google up some videos of the Vision only vehicles doing their thing and you'll see the behavior is still the same, it's just that now we're seeing vision car stuff.</p>

I drove to the health club this morning (about a 10 minute drive) and then to work (about 15 minutes) using it. It did a lot better than I thought. On my first drive I couldn't engage it from my driveway, but I drove into the street in front of my driveway, and it drove me all the way to the roundabout at the club with no disengagements. Traffic was light, but I was impressed. It accelerated and braked a lot harder than I would have, but nothing unsafe. On the drive to work, it also did a fine job. There were only three things it did that were unusual. There was a stop sign ahead of me by 50 feet or so, and a side street to my left. It stopped 50 feet short and then said creeping up. The car that was at the stop sign ahead of me by 50 feet then moved forward, and so did my car to the stop sign. There was nobody behind me so I didn't disengage. There was also a time when I was at a stoplight and turning right onto a busy 3 lane highway. It crept forward, and although I would have gone, it continued to wait. I touched the accelerator to make the car go, and it did the rest of the route just fine. I probably didn't have to press the accelerator, but I didn't want to wait. It was creeping up to a stop sign, and someone stepped off the curb into the crosswalk ahead of me. It braked fairly hard (even though it was going less than 5MPH) and stopped short a few feet in front of the stop sign, even though it could have gone up to the marker safely. I guess better safe than sorry.It stopped AutoPilot at the street in front of work instead of going into the parking lot (the address entered was the official street address on the main street) so that seems right. There were no safety interventions, and like I said I was pretty impressed. I can see how incremental refinements will just make this better and better.</p>

It is impressive when it work correctly, but I had several times where the car turned on the right blinker and stop in the lane like it either wanted to make a right turn where one doesn't exist or pulling over for an emergency vehicle and again none were around.

When approaching a right-hand turn, the car doesn't want to encroach into the bike lane at all even when the solid white line becomes dashed. This makes the cars behind you think you are going to turn left. I hope this is low-hanging fruit that gets fixed soon; it caused an issue at both right-hand turns for other drivers in my first 1-mile test drive.</p>

Pretty painful to use, and not sure that I’ll be showing this to anyone. I had somewhere around 15 disengagements in less than 5 miles, but it was some of the smaller things that were the most annoying. Driving down a street with traffic lights every 5-10 blocks, it would slow ~2 mph at almost every side street without a light. And turn signals! It put them on multiple times when the road just goes around a bend, or at a four way stop when going straight ahead at just a slight angle. Really confusing to other drivers who thought I was going to turn onto a different street. Takes forever at stop signs, but that’s easy enough to goose with the accelerator. One thing it did do really well and confidently was a lane change from right to left when approaching a bus stopped in the right lane.</p>

With the excitement of getting the FSD Beta, I did not read the details before and thought it was going to replace the previous FSD automatically. What a difference now! I went from my home to my office with no interventions. It stopped roughly in front of blinking yellow lights and crossed over some solid white lines, but everything else was great.</p>

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">26. So, I just did a little trip tonight with little to no traffic. We SERIOUSLY need some guidance from the FSD engineering team about what sorts of things they want us to report. WHAT DO THEY WANT TO KNOW? For example, the car turned into a bike lane and drove in it for a little bit before figuring out it wasn't supposed to be there and it very abruptly moved into the correct lane. I was too busy minding the car to push the "report" icon. On residential streets with no center stripe the car drove right down the center, even when cars come at you the other way, FSD had a hard time with that. It did our roundabout in town, but only after stopping and thinking about it for a while and then proceeded with "great haste" to get through it. Unacceptable if there were any other cars on the road. Then it gave up driving over our Otowi bridge. Two lanes were closed off for bridge repairs and the cones directed us into the "wrong lane" (which was set up for 2 way traffic) and it freaked out and gave up. All of these incidents are interesting and reportable I think... but do they want to hear about ALL of them? I dare not take my hands off the wheel or eyes off the road to push the little report icon every time. It's all very very cool and I want to be a useful beta tester but I need some advice on how to best report all these things. I did send a report Email tonight and asked this very question. I'll post here if I get some good feedback.</p>

That is because I'm used to driving closer to the right edge of the road in such situations. However, looking at the visualization, the car is driving in the center of its half of the road. Just feels strange, particularly going around curves. My car also moves closer to the right side of the road when necessary. For example, when a big truck is coming from the opposite direction.</p>

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">28. I’m in! Got the FSD beta downloaded and installed Yesterday morning! First drive was very good, even impressed the Mrs. For those who are waiting, I think I was a late first batch my score was 99 going into last Friday, but by Sunday night I was at 100. After a few takeovers and a ding for Autopilot disengagement (my passenger was FaceTiming during the drive, interior camera A.I. detected the phone and disengaged after 3 warnings, I kept rotating the steering wheel thinking it was checking if I was holding it, but it was due to the phone) my score was 99 late in the afternoon, by evening my safety score checking ability was removed from my app. No doubt the data is still being recorded by Tesla I enabled the enhanced FSD view in the settings, but in order for it to show you need to tap the compass top right corner of the map. This mornings ride was great, a couple jerky right turns, I think its the cars inability to see the lane markings clearly through the whole curve. Car bounced between a couple unnecessary lane changes before getting itself into the correct lane, downtown driving was smoother, probably due to the lower speed. FSD performs much better at lower speed, I have my AP speed limit offset set to -1, I use the scroll wheel constantly to adjust speed up or down, depending of my confidence level. I did notice a degradation in performance (A.I. confidence) during drives when the sun was low in the sky, shadows or glare may have something to do with that. One last point, may have been discussed, FSD does not recognize neighborhood entry gates, just a heads up.Looks as the 99’s will get the 10.3 soon, I’m looking forward to seeing what incremental improvements come with the next updates.</p>

                     <p>I can confirm that Beta FSD just stops at yellow blinking left turn arrows. They must not have those down in the Fremont CA area?

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">29. Tested in a small town with light traffic and poorly marked roads. I'd give it a C. It failed to turn on a road with high speed traffic approaching despite no visibility issues. There was plenty of time to pull out but it didn't. It had a lot of trouble knowing where to drive due to some wide roads with no markings. I had to adjust the speed quite a bit. It got too close to one car on a turn and either bailed or I tugged too hard. The turns are not natural and it tended to start turning the opposite direction like it needed to make a really wide turn but it didn't. It also over accelerates in most cases after a turn. For the most part it got from point A to point B and there were some positives with giving peds space and stopping at all the stop signs.</p>

Pros: smooth lane changes, speed setting to flow with traffic rather than +5 limit, shy away from bicyclists, no more fiddling with continuing through green lights, no more fiddling with autopilot because a turn is upcoming, just a more natural drive (minus the cons below), good slowing for speed bumps, probably more I forgot Cons: difficulty choosing the correct lane in a timely manner for some turns, need to goose the accelerator sometimes for turns, now I have to deal with bad map data, figuring out how best to take turns on the unmarked, no curb, roads in my neighborhood (some "drunk driving" action there. I can readily imagine getting pulled over if there were cops around)</p>

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">32. I'm not going to lie, I was super excited to get to finally try the FSD Beta to see what progress had been made through these years of waiting. When I finally got the build pushed to my car I took it for a daily commute to the gym. Here's how it went. The profile is on Assertive btw. Driving through the neighborhood I understand it treats it as any other road but the car travels literally in the middle of the road so I have to disable it until I get out of neighborhood. Turning out of neighborhood the creep is so slow and when it finally decides to go after sitting for a little while with no cars coming, it's just too slow. Here's where I was pretty impressed at the 4 way stop sign, it does really well at detected when it's turn is but again it's commitment to go is just way to slow so I find myself always on the acceleration pedal to speed it along before someone honks at me. When entering a 2 lane left turn, it chose the one on the very left and what shocked me was it committed too hard and fast this time yanking me into the furthest lane. It then failed to correctly make the turn though. It also failed to make the turn at the light to my gym but that turn is a bit hard because of how sharp it is. I drive this commute every single day so I hope to see FSD grow enough to where I can actually babysit it and not intervene every second. I just wanted to share my experience with it and a bit of my disappointment as I've had FSD for around 3 years now.</p>

                     <p>Agree with everything you said. In addition to the center of the road neighborhood driving it goes too fast and accelerates too fast. I’ve tried all 3 settings and it turns and accelerates way too fast a lot. We have a lot of 45-50mph roads with 90 degree turns onto a 25mph road. It usually thinks hey it’s 100 yards away I better speed up and then at the last second take the turn at 40. It’s just way too aggressive when it needs to chill and way to chill when it needs to be aggressive. Blinking yellows freak it out too. Also has some weird turn behavior where it doesn’t use the turn signal all the time for me.</p><hr>
                     <p>Nope. I got the FSD Beta yesterday and it is rough. Tried to ram through a community gate at 30mph. Stopped and stalled out making an unprotected left turn. And just in general drives very very poorly in even the most basic of situations. I can see why they delayed pushing it out so long, but I am curious just how terrible the v8 and v9 FSD beta was if these are the orders of magnitude improvements we're seeing now because at this rate we'll need about 50 more of them before this thing matches regular autopilot.</p><hr>
                     <p>Sometimes I’m impressed by how it handles a straight and regular city street. Most times I am extremely mind bogglingly frustrated by how it decided to handle anything but a straight and regular street. I get that it’s beta, 100%, but this thing is not ready one bit. My recommendation to Tesla is to keep the beta group right where it’s at size-wise for 5-10 updates. With the NHTSA hot after regulation, this is not going to end well for Tesla or Tesla consumers if they keep expanding. I realized through the past few weeks of pain and torment w/ SS and now beta access that I bought the car because I like to zip around and genuinely love the tech it is really great at. I won’t be renewing my subscription come November.
