                  <p style="font-size: 20px">30. Imagine for a moment an alternate universe where the standard gas-station experience is reserved only for drivers of one type of car. Toyota owners, let's say, can pull up to a pump, swipe their credit card, and fill up in a flash. But everybody else has to endure the cumbersome process of fumbling through an app, signing up for a membership, or tapping a worn-out touchscreen before unleashing the flow of fuel. Riveting as it may sound, this is not the premise of the next dystopian blockbuster starring Timothée Chalamet (although Mad Max: Gas Wars does have a nice ring to it). In a nutshell, this is the reality that electric-vehicle owners face today: A world where charging is remarkably seamless for people who drive a Tesla and often frustrating for everyone else. Using one of Tesla's Supercharger stations for the first time illustrated just how effortless filling up one of Elon Musk's vehicles is compared to other electric cars. While non-Tesla owners rely on a patchwork of charging providers — all with their own phone apps, memberships, and costs — Tesla drivers enjoy exclusive access to the easy-to-use Supercharger network. Superchargers are plentiful, simple to find, straightforward to operate, and may be the best reason to choose a Tesla over a competitor. 
EV owners mostly charge at home in their garages, but every so often one needs to plug in during a longer trip or while out and about. That's where Superchargers and other DC fast-charging stations come in. Tesla has been building out its Supercharger network since 2012 and has some 1,500 stations in the US, more than any other charging company. Finding Superchargers in a Tesla takes just a few taps of its iPad-like screen. When the time came to charge the Model Y I was testing, I clicked a lightning-bolt icon on the map to browse nearby chargers, filtered for the most powerful plugs, and navigated to one that had stalls available.

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">31. Tesla's first V4 Supercharger is expected to be opening soon in Yuma County, Arizona. According to Tesla's Supercharger map, this location has a target opening in Q4 2022. Twitter user MarcoRPTesla shared the plans of Tesla's upcoming V4 Supercharger. According to the plans shared in MarcoRPTesla’s tweet, there will be 40 stalls, plus 4,500 square foot solar arrays and a Megapack. All of this is planned to be placed on a new vacant lot by the Dateland Travel Center along Interstate 8 on the San Diego to Tucson route. 
“The access to the vacant lot is located on the southeast corner of the travel center property,” adds MarcoRPTesla. “The chargers themselves are a very short distance from the building. There are two ADA-accessible stalls, as well as one designated pull-through stall for trailers. “There will be two solar canopies, one covering the main block of 24 chargers (excluding the pull-through), and another covering the remaining 16. They will have Tesla logos on the side, a bit like the ones at Firebaugh [CA] and Baker [CA].” The full details of the V4 Superchargers were unveiled in architectural drawings for Tesla’s new Danvers, Massachusetts location. V4 will be taller, coming in at 6 feet, 4 1/4 inches, and thinner than V3 Superchargers. They’ll be capable of charging speeds up to 350kW, but Tesla has not unlocked those speeds yet.

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">32. Tesla has opened its first Supercharger stations to non-Tesla electric vehicles in Iceland as part of its pilot program. Over the last year, we have been reporting on Tesla ramping up its effort to open the Supercharger network, its extensive global network of fast-charging stations, to electric vehicles from other automakers. In November 2021, we saw Tesla take its first step in that direction with a pilot program running at 10 Supercharger stations in the Netherlands that allowed non-Tesla EV owners to charge using the Tesla app. When announcing the new pilot program, Tesla said that it planned to slowly expand it to test more broadly the user experience for both non-Tesla EV owners new to the network and current Tesla owners who will experience more traffic at Tesla charging stations. In January, the automaker announced that the program was expanding to more stations in Norway and France. A month later, the program was expanded to all Supercharger stations in the Netherlands. A few weeks after that, Tesla again expanded the pilot program, this time to include some Supercharger stations in the UK, Spain, Sweden, Belgium, and Austria. In May, the automaker added Spain and the UK to the program. Tesla then expanded the program again to include Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, and Switzerland. A month later, Tesla opened up the pilot program to most European countries. The automaker has been quiet on the subject over the last few months, but now it is making a new expansion of the pilot program. Today, Tesla announced that it is expanding its Supercharger pilot program for non-Tesla EVs to most Supercharger stations in Iceland.

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">33. The Tesla Charging Twitter account has taken a page out of Elon Musk's social media strategy playbook. With more than 73 thousand followers, the account tweeted: Supercharger Voting coming soon. Reply with location suggestions — replies with the most likes will be included in the poll. The tweet has grabbed a lot of attention as suggested locations have been pouring in.

Tesla already has a vast network of Superchargers across the globe, and that grid is constantly expanding. The Tesla Charging account's primary use is to announce openings of new supercharger locations worldwide. There are occasional retweets of someone's observations at a site. But, it receives a countless number of suggested locations daily.

The account had thousands of responses within hours of pinning the tweet to the top of its profile. Many replies included screen grabs of maps showing distances between Supercharger locations. Some others show non-service or dead zone areas. There were also numerous responses of sites with chargers that were too busy. But, of course, with this on social media, there are plenty of different and humorous opinions. Ironically, one user wants a location at a place called Dodge City.
