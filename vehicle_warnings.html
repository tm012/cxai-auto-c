                  <p style="font-size: 20px">The car sometimes freaks out when it totally doesn't need to. If the light turns yellow and it thinks you're not going to make it, it will lose it's mind with sound alerts and red warnings flashing on the screen. This also happens if it gets confused about road markings and thinks it's going to crash. Elon (Musk) said their criteria for getting into the FSD beta will depend on how you drive and whether or not the car is freaking out a bunch like I mentioned above. But the fact is that it's sometime unavoidable because the car is just overly-cautious sometimes. Full Self Driving for us regular folks is limited to single-road driving. Meaning, it will not turn from one street onto another or take you from point A to B. If you want into the beta, you gotta drive like a saint for "7 days." And access can be revoked any time even after it's granted.</p>

It’s horrible- not smooth, false warnings, doesn’t slow down for tight turns but slows down for no reason. If beta is good it should replace the public build which is not safe around town, in my opinion.</p>

                     <p>There is no public build for around-town use. It’s for limited-access roads and handles intersections only cursorily by means of obeying traffic controls only. Use it correctly and it’ll save you stress over thousands of miles of driving, as many of us will attest.</p><hr>
                     <p>Sorry for any confusion. I have the standard FSD, not the beta. I signed up for the beta and to provide input on my driving I’m using FSD much more than normal. I love it on the highway but on local roads I find it very unpleasant. When you mentioned turns I don’t mean turns at intersections. I mean curvy roads. When I’m driving 45 and the road has a tight bend ahead I slow down. But in my experience FSD doesn’t. My impression is that beta does slow down more like what a driver would do. I hope that clarifies.</p><hr>

It is impressive when it work correctly, but I had several times where the car turned on the right blinker and stop in the lane like it either wanted to make a right turn where one doesn't exist or pulling over for an emergency vehicle and again none were around. It made a couple of minor mistakes, nothing that made me feel unsafe but did make for an interesting drive this morning.</p>

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">I had pretty low expectations and knew it would struggle in my urban neighborhood, but this reminds me a lot of Smart Summon. Pretty painful to use, and not sure that I’ll be showing this to anyone. I had somewhere around 15 disengagements in less than 5 miles, but it was some of the smaller things that were the most annoying. Driving down a street with traffic lights every 5-10 blocks, it would slow ~2 mph at almost every side street without a light. And turn signals! It put them on multiple times when the road just goes around a bend, or at a four way stop when going straight ahead at just a slight angle. Really confusing to other drivers who thought I was going to turn onto a different street. Takes forever at stop signs, but that’s easy enough to goose with the accelerator. One thing it did do really well and confidently was a lane change from right to left when approaching a bus stopped in the right lane.</p>
