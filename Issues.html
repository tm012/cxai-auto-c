Over the weekend, Tesla finally released 10.69.2. It cautiously rolled out the update to a few beta testers. Some Beta testers have kept in touch with Teslarati about update 10.69 and shared a few of their insights. 

PHANTOM BRAKING
After several conversations with Beta testers, there are a few issues that they repeatedly bring up. The first and foremost issue that keeps getting mentioned is phantom braking. Although, Beta tester Howard did acknowledge that phantom braking occurred “a little less” after downloading 10.69.1.1. And long-time Early Access software tester Les from Fort Worth, Texas said he rarely experiences phantom braking. 

TURNS
After phantom braking, the second-most mentioned issue mentioned by Beta testers is turns. Les said that his vehicle didn’t seem to stay in the proper turn lane. He noted that the turning issue has been around since October 2021. 

Beta Tester Robert, who runs FSD Beta 2022.12.3.20, still has difficulty with hard turns. 

“It powers forward and then slams on the brakes at the last minute with turn signal only moments before the turn. It’s inviting rear end collisions and speeding tickets,” he said.

SPEED LIMITS
A few Beta testers have also mentioned issues with speed limits. Robert noted problems with speed limit changes. 

“Biggest issue they need to address is the failure of the software to slow the car in advance of speed limit changes, traffic lights, and hard turns. It powers forward and then slams on the brakes at the last minute with [a] turn signal only moments before the turn. It’s inviting rear-end collisions and speeding tickets,” Robert shared.

Model S owner, Howard, told Teslarati that his vehicle ignored some speed signs. He also observed that his Model S would sometimes cruise at 60 mph, but the car’s display would read 35 mph. 

More FSD Beta tester reviews on v.10.69.1.1 were included in a previous Teslarati article. The verdict is still out on FSD Beta 10.69.2. Testers will probably be sharing their insights in the following week or so.

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">18. Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta testers used to report quite frequently that when the autonomous mode was enabled, their vehicle often didn’t stop at stop signs, which is illegal in the US and the automaker issued a recall to fix the feature prompted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The stop sign running issue also seemed to coincide with the introduction of FSD modes (Chill, Average and Assertive), but Tesla says it has taken steps to fix the issue. Well, now an FSD beta tester says he got a ticket precisely for the fact that his Tesla Model 3 didn’t stop completely when it approached a stop sign. He doesn’t say which of the three modes he had selected at the time, just that when the vehicle was supposed to stop, it kept rolling and it did it in front of a police patrol and this resulted in him getting a ticket for not having observed the sign. The driver says he even had a chat about FSD with the officer who pulled him over, who in turn said that his cousin was also an FSD tester, yet he still received a citation not only for the stop sign violation, but also for speeding, which he says he was forced to do because the vehicle was getting onto a faster road and needed to accelerate so as to not risk being rear-ended... After watching Detroit Tesla’s video twice, I’m still not sure exactly what happened, but if the issue was as he seems to describe it, well, he was fully responsible for anything the vehicle did (even on its own) with him at the wheel. He notes that the speeding charge didn’t stick in court, but that even with the help of a lawyer, they couldn’t get the other one dropped too.

Although Tesla CEO Elon Musk portrays the software as a prelude to fully autonomous vehicles, a quick online search shows videos of FSD-enabled Teslas in North America aiming straight at pedestrians, crashing into parked cars, and slowing down on a highway for no discernible reason. Unsurprisingly, more than a few observers have declared FSD to be a menace to traffic safety.

But if you look for similar videos of FSD-enabled Teslas stumbling their way through Europe’s cobblestone streets, you’ll come up empty. It’s not because Tesla’s system is better able to navigate San Sebastián than San Francisco; there are simply no FSD videos from Europe at all.
Why? FSD isn’t approved for public use there. 
Tesla cannot deploy FSD anywhere in the European Union unless it first obtains a green light from regulators. To obtain that approval, Tesla must convincingly demonstrate that cars with FSD are at least as safe as those without it. At least so far, it hasn’t.
Unlike their European peers, American car regulators do not require — or even offer — any kind of safety preapproval for a new car model or technology. Instead, car companies “self-certify” that their vehicles comply with federal guidelines pertaining to everything from steering wheels to brake fluids. But no such rules address the driver assistance and autonomous technologies that are critical to the car’s future — and to the safety of everyone who walks, bikes, or drives. 
Facing no significant oversight, automakers like Tesla can legally deploy any advanced driver-assist system (ADAS) they like, regardless of how dangerous it may be. According to federal law, only if the Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) observes a pattern of dangerous problems can it launch an investigation (which NHTSA is now doing with Tesla), potentially culminating in a recall. Until then, the cars under investigation can continue zooming along American roads and streets.
Musk himself summed up the transatlantic distinction during a speech earlier this year in Berlin: “In the US things are legal by default, and in Europe they’re illegal by default.”

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">20. First of all, for background, note that FSD was one of my top 4 reasons for buying a Tesla Model 3, and I’d be more than thrilled if FSD got to robotaxi-level capability — and the sooner, the better. I’m also a longtime TSLA shareholder, so any claims that I’d write anything negative about Tesla to hurt the stock are laughable. Lastly, just on a pure website traffic basis, we get much more love for pro-Tesla content than anti-Tesla content — the conspiracy theory that we’d write things critical of Tesla for clicks is ludicrous. If I have any bias, it is a pro-Tesla bias from wanting Tesla to succeed in this arena. All of that said, I do try hard to look at things objectively, without bias. Our job here is to tell true and important stories in order to help society. Any critique that I have of Tesla’s FSD system is a critique I’d rather not have, but it’s not something I’m going to deny just because I’d rather it not exist. To address one more concern I’ve seen some people express, I do not at all think that my analysis here is due to impatience or any bad feelings. Elon Musk has been doing his best to guide FSD forward and to forecast its development correctly, and I’m sure that goes for the FSD/Autopilot team as well. I do not feel ripped off, and I am not at all bitter. But looking at FSD in what I think are the most realistic eyes, I just see a lot of flaws and find it very hard to see genuine, notable improvement.
I received the latest Tesla FSD Beta update (10.69.2) today and almost immediately took it out for a short drive — not because I expected much from it, but because I needed to go to the store and was going alone (so didn’t have to worry about the driving experience for any other passengers in the car). I will have to use it more to see how well it is driving in different scenarios, but just on this short trip, which was on almost completely empty suburban roads, it displayed the same problems it’s had as long as I’ve had it. It drove far too fast and jerky around certain curves, some parked cars, and some turns. It continued to phantom brake — though, nothing severe on this short hop to the store and back. (I did not experience any phantom swerving, thankfully.) It continued to use the brakes (not regen) far too much, because it drives too fast toward stop signs and red lights and waits too long to slow down. The Model 3 continued to take far too long to jerkily make some turns due to a combination of factors that somehow freak the car out and make it think for a long time (note: this does not even include intersections with moving vehicles, pedestrians, or squirrels).

                  <p style="font-size: 20px">21. Tesla owner Kim Paquette posted on her YouTube channel the trials she went through with a Model 3 (equipped with FSD Beta 10.69 software) while crossing a rather busy intersection.
The video shows that the woman is trying to get through the intersection but, considering that this is no ordinary intersection, the electric car experiences some rather strange commands. The whole experiment was captured on camera.

First, the woman tries to make a left turn but the car is positioned incorrectly for this maneuver. If the driver had not intervened, the Tesla would have entered an area dedicated to oncoming traffic. The electric car's attempts can be seen on the display.
Then Kim tries to go through the intersection on the diagonal, except that to get to where she wanted, the car would need to stop in the middle of the road to let the intersecting cars pass. This operation is repeated twice, but each time, it required the driver's intervention to avoid an accident.
”3 attempts at this intersection. First time as unprotected left, 2 and 3 trying to go straight across. Intersection is on the diagonal and my car struggles any way it tries to do it,” Kim notes in the description of the video uploaded to YouTube.
How this car reacts in such an intersection, in a very complex traffic scenario, could be an excellent homework assignment for the team working on future improvements to Tesla's autonomous driving systems.
The problem might have already been fixed in the latest update. Recently, Elon Musk revealed via Twitter that Tesla's autonomous driving system, the FSD Beta, on its current 10.69 version, will bring two new releases in two weeks. The first update will arrive the following week, with version 10.69.1 being available starting Monday night (August 29th) and Beta version 10.69.2 coming in the ”week or so” after.
